Tasty Fishcakes

Ingredients:
half a huge red onion
3 jalapenos finely diced (one with seeds)
6 (one bunch) of scalions
4 big cloves of crushed garlic
garlic powder
2 eggs
3 cans of canned tuna in oil
6 heaping tablespoons of crushed *toasted* sesame seeds (seems like a lot but trust me)
1 tbps soy sauce
2 tsp sesame oil

1 - Finely dice half onion and jalapenos. Finely slice scalions. In a pan, cook veggies until translucent.
2 - In a large bowl, mix tuna, veggies, garlic, cracked eggs, soy sauce and sesame oil.
3 - Place sesame seeds on aluminum plate and broil in the oven until golden brown. Don't go anywhere, they'll burn in a jiffy!
4 - Crush sesame seeds and add to the mix.
5 - Make 12 patties and cook in a pan for 2-3 minutes on both sides.
